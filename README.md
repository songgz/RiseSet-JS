# RiseSet-JS

## Synopsis

This is a set of Javascript functions to compute sunrise, sunset, moonrise and
moonset, based on the formulae published in Jean Meeus's book, [Astronomical
Algorithms](http://www.willbell.com/math/mc1.HTM "Astronomical Algorithms"),
published by Willmann-Bell, Inc.

## Explanation

There are a few such libraries already available but they didn't fit my needs
(i.e. documented accuracy, well referenced algorithms and free to use) so I
decided to write my own.

This library will eventually come in three different flavours:

 + **Full** - The full equations, as published in the literature.
 + **Normal** - The functions optimised to minimise the amount of code required,
and enhance numerical performance.
 + **Minified** - A minified version of the normal library, suitable for use on
websites.

[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ "Jasmine") is used for unit testing
this library and V1.1.0 of the standalone version is included in the `test` directory.  Simple open the `riseset
